   <b>Bone grafting </b> – also known as ridge and sinus augmentation – is a procedure used to build up the bone beneath the surface of the gums. The bones in the upper and lower arch of the mouth are responsible for supporting the teeth. When one or more teeth fall out, bone resorption occurs naturally. When patients decide to replace missing teeth with dental implants, insufficient bone mass can prevent them from qualifying for the procedure. Bone grafting addresses inadequate bone mass by filling in eroded areas with bone harvested from the patient’s own body, or that of a cadaver or animal. The new bone helps promote new bone growth that will eventually support a dental implant.

            <b>Dental veneers</b> are a conservative way of completely making over your smile? In fact, veneers are a go-to cosmetic procedure that has become popular with celebrities who want a brighter and more symmetrical smile. Miley Cyrus, Hilary Duff and Ben Affleck are just some of Hollywood’s elite who have seen a cosmetic dentist for laminates. Fortunately, affordability and accessibility make it easy for anyone to get dental veneers – including patients.

  <font color="#b666d2">Frequently Asked Questions...</font>
</h1>
  <p class="ven2">
        <b> Am I a candidate for dental implants?</b>
You may be a candidate for dental implants if you are missing one or more teeth. You’ll need a complete surgical consultation with x-rays to determine whether you are in good health and have adequate bone structure to support dental implants. In some cases where the bone is not dense enough to support an implant, surgical bone grafting may make it possible to support one in the future. It is also important to ensure you do not have any existing health conditions, such as gum disease, that could cause complications with your implants.
          </p>


<h1 class="fact3">
  <font color="#b666d2">Post-treatment Care instructions...</font>
</h1>
  <p class="ven3">
      <b>Dental implant</b> placement is a surgical procedure that requires a period of recovery. During this time, it is common to experience some swelling and soreness, as well as bleeding and minor bruising near the surgical site. Your oral surgeon will recommend eating only soft foods during the first several days following implant surgery. It is also important to follow all instructions for post-surgical care, including cleaning the surgical site and using any medications as prescribed. Be sure to contact your surgeon if you experience any fever or discomfort that worsens after a few days.
